# Lighthouse Labs - Chatty App

## Introductory React Project

By Aaron Bolarinho

Hello and Welcome!

### Overview

This single page app was the first project we did after being introduced to React.

The challenge of this project was to recreate the app according to the its specifications.

 - Javascript
 - Node.js and server-side middle-ware
 - Html, CSS, and basic front-end formatting
 - React

** Lighthouse Labs Chatty App**

This small project is a single page chatroom app built with a React front end.

Any user who travels to the url where the app is live can chat in the chat room; and users can choose their display name as well.

As the app does not have a back-end, all the messages are stored in the state of the main React component.
